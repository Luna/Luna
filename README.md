### Project components

Enso consists of several sub projects:

  * **Enso Engine**  
    The [Enso Engine](./engine/) is the , which consists of the
    compiler, type-checker, runtime and language server. These components implement
    Enso the language in its entirety, and are usable in isolation. 

    You can download the Enso Engine from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/enso-org/enso/releases) of this repository. For more information on how to run the Enso Engine, please refer to the documentation on [getting Enso](https://github.com/enso-org/enso/blob/main/docs/getting-enso.md).

  * **Enso IDE**. 
    The [Enso IDE](https://github.com/enso-org/ide) is the desktop application that allows working with visual Enso. It consists of an Electron application, a high     performance WebGL UI framework, and the Searcher which provides search, hints, and documentation for Enso functions.

    You can download the Enso IDE from the [GitHub Releases of the IDE repository](https://github.com/enso-org/ide/releases). For more information on usage of the IDE, please refer to the [101 tutorial](https://github.com/enso-org/tutorial_101) and the [product documentation](https://dev.enso.org/docs/ide/product/).

### Enso's Design

If you would like to gain a better understanding of the principles on which Enso
is based, or just delve into the why's and what's of Enso's design, please take
a look in the [`docs/` folder](./docs/). It is split up into subfolders for each
component of Enso. You can view this same documentation in a rendered form at
[the developer docs website](https://dev.enso.org).

This folder also contains a document on Enso's
[design philosophy](./docs/enso-philosophy.md), that details the thought process
that we use when contemplating changes or additions to the language.

This documentation will evolve as Enso does, both to help newcomers to the
project understand the reasoning behind the code, but also to act as a record of
the decisions that have been made through Enso's evolution.
