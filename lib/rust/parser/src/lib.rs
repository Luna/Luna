//! The Enso parser. Parsing is a multi-stage process:
//!
//! # Lexing.
//! First, the source code is feed to [`lexer::Lexer`], which consumes it and outputs a stream of
//! [`Token`]. Tokens are chunks of the input with a generic description attached, like "operator",
//! or "identifier".
//!
//! # Building macro registry.
//! Macros in Enso are a very powerful mechanism and are used to transform group of tokens into
//! almost any statement. First, macros need to be discovered and registered. Currently, there is no
//! real macro discovery process, as there is no support for user-defined macros. Instead, there is
//! a set of hardcoded macros defined in the compiler.
//!
//! Each macro defines one or more segments. Every segment starts with a predefined token and can
//! contain any number of other tokens. For example, the macro `if ... then ... else ...` contains
//! three segments. Macros can also accept prefix tokens, a set of tokens on the left of the first
//! segment. A good example is the lambda macro `... -> ...`.
//!
//! In this step, a [`MacroMatchTree`] is built. Basically, it is a map from the possible next
//! segment name to information of what other segments are required and what is the macro definition
//! in case these segments were found. For example, let's consider two macros: `if ... then ...`,
//! and `if ... then ... else ...`. In such a case, the macro registry will contain only one entry,
//! "if", and two sets of possible resolution paths: ["then"], and ["then", "else"], each associated
//! with the corresponding macro definition.
//!
//! # Splitting the token stream by the macro segments.
//! The input token stream is being iterated and is being split based on the segments of the
//! registered macros. For example, for the input `if a b then c d else e f`, the token stream will
//! be split into three segments, `a b`, `c d`, and `e f`, which will be associated with the
//! `if ... then ... else ...` macro definition.
//!
//! The splitting process is hierarchical. It means that a new macro can start being resolved during
//! resolution of a parent macro. For example, `if if a then b then c else d` is a correct
//! expression. After finding the first `if` token, the token stream will be split. The next `if`
//! token starts a new token stream splitting. The first `then` token belongs to the nested macro,
//! however, as soon as the resolver sees the second `then` token, it will consider the nested macro
//! to be finished, and will come back to parent macro resolution.
//!
//! # Resolving right-hand-side patterns of macro segments.
//! In the next steps, each macro is being analyzed, started from the most nested ones. For each
//! macro, the [`Pattern`] of last segment is being run to check which tokens belong to that macro,
//! and which tokens should be transferred to parent macro definition. For example, consider the
//! following code `process (read file) content-> print content`. The `(...)` is a macro with two
//! sections `(` and `)`. Let's mark the token splitting with `[` and `]` characters. The previous
//! macro resolution steps would output such split of the token stream:
//! `process [(read file][) content[-> print content]]`. In this step, the most inner macro will be
//! analyzed first. The pattern of the last segment of the inner macro (`->`) defines that it
//! consumes all tokens, so all the tokens `print content` are left as they are. Now, the resolution
//! moves to the parent macro. Its last segment starts with the `)` token, which pattern defines
//! that it does not consume any tokens, so all of its current tokens (`content[-> print content]]`)
//! are popped to a parent definition, forming `process [(read file][)] content[-> print content]`.
//!
//! Please note, that root of the expression is considered a special macro as well. It is done for
//! the algorithm unification purposes.
//!
//! # Resolving left-hand-side patterns of macro segments.
//! In this step, each macro is being analyzed, started from the most nested ones. For each macro,
//! the [`Pattern`] of the macro prefix is being run to check which tokens belong to the prefix of
//! the macro (in case the macro defines the prefix). In the example above, the macro `->` defines
//! complex prefix rules: if the token on the left of the arrow used no space, then only a single
//! token will be consumed. As a result of this step, the following token split will occur:
//! `[process [(read file][)] [content-> print content]`, which is exactly what we wanted.
//!
//! # Resolving patterns of macro segments.
//! In this step, all macro segment patterns are being resolved and errors are reported in case it
//! was not possible. If tokens in a segment match the segment pattern, they are sent to the
//! operator precedence resolver for final transformation.
//!
//! # Operator precedence resolution.
//! Each token stream sent to the operator resolver is processed by a modified Shunting Yard
//! algorithm, which handles such situations as multiple operators placed next to each other,
//! multiple identifiers placed next to each other, and also takes spacing into consideration in
//! order to implement spacing-aware precedence rules. After all segments are resolved, the macro
//! is being treated as a single token in one of the segments of the parent macro, and is being
//! processed by the operator precedence resolver as well. In the end, a single [`syntax::Tree`] is
//! produced, containing the parsed expression.
