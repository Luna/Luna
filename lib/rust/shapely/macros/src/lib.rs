/// methods.

/// The iterators will:
/// * for structs: go over each field that declared type is same as the struct's last type
///   parameter.
/// * enums: delegate to current constructor's nested value's iterator.
///
/// Enums are required to use only a single element tuple-like variant. This
/// limitation should be lifted in the future.
///
/// Any dependent type stored in struct, tuple or wrapped in enum should have
/// dependency only in its last type parameter. All dependent types that are not
/// tuples nor directly the yielded type, are required to provide `iter` method
/// that returns a compatible iterator (possible also derived).

/// variant of an enum at compile time. The derive panics if used on non-enum types.

/// The derive creates a macro (hereafter called loop-macro) named `for_each_NAME_variant` where
/// `NAME` is replaced with the name of the enum converted to snake case. The loop-macro takes a
/// name of another macro (hereafter called iterator-macro) as an argument followed by a
/// parenthesized list of extra arguments. The loop-macro expands to a call of the iterator-macro
/// with a list of comma-separated names of the enum variants wrapped in square brackets, followed
/// by the extra arguments defined above.

/// ```no_compile
/// #[derive(ForEachVariant)]
/// pub enum FooBar {
///     Foo,
///     Bar,
/// }
