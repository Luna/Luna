/// For generic types no bounds are introduced in the generated implementation. To customize this
/// behavior user might add `#[clone_ref(bound="â€¦")]` attribute. Then the generated implementation
/// will use the provided bounds.
///
/// Moreover, for a given struct `X` this macro generates also `impl From<&X> for X` which uses
/// `CloneRef` under the hood. The semantics of `CloneRef` makes each object to naturally provide
/// transformation from reference to an owned type.

/// Implements the `ForEachVariant` derive macro which creates a helper for iterating over each
/// variant of an enum at compile time. The derive panics if used on non-enum types.
///
/// The derive creates a macro (hereafter called loop-macro) named `for_each_NAME_variant` where
/// `NAME` is replaced with the name of the enum converted to snake case. The loop-macro takes a
/// name of another macro (hereafter called iterator-macro) as an argument followed by a
/// parenthesized list of extra arguments. The loop-macro expands to a call of the iterator-macro
/// with a list of comma-separated names of the enum variants wrapped in square brackets, followed
/// by the extra arguments defined above.
///
/// For example, the following code:
/// ```no_compile
/// #[derive(ForEachVariant)]
/// pub enum FooBar {
///     Foo,
///     Bar,
/// }
/// ```
/// results in the following macro being defined:
/// ```

///     ( $f:ident($( $args:tt )*) ) => { $f!([Foo, Bar] $($args)*) }
