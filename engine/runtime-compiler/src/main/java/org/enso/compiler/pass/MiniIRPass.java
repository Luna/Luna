/**
 * Mini IR pass operates on a single IR element at a time. The {@link org.enso.compiler.Compiler}
 * traverses the whole IR tree in DFS. It works in two phases.
 *
 * <p><b>Note</b> that the current implementation is limited to traverse only {@link
 * org.enso.compiler.core.ir.Expression} elements as provided by {@link
 * IR#mapExpressions(Function)}. Hence, the additional method {@link #transformModule(Module)}.
 *
 * <p>In the first, <b>prepare</b> phase, the compiler traverses from the root to the leaves and
 * calls the {@link #prepare(Expression)} method on the mini pass. During this phase, the mini pass
 * can gather information about the current IR element, but not modify it.
 *
 * <p>In the second, <b>transform</b> phase, the compiler returns from the leaves to the root and
 * calls the {@link #transformExpression(Expression)} method on the mini pass. During this phase,
 * the mini pass is free to transform the current IR element. The children of the current IR element
 * are already transformed.
 *
 * <p>For each IR element:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>The {@link #prepare(Expression)} method is called to prepare the pass for the current IR
 *       element. This method is called when the {@link org.enso.compiler.Compiler} traverses the IR
 *       tree from top to bottom. This is useful for mini passes that need to build some information
 *       about the current IR element before transforming it. The mini pass must not modify the IR
 *       element neither attach any metadata to it in this method. By returning {@code null} from
 *       this method, the mini pass signals to the compiler that it wishes to not process the
 *       subtree of the current IR element.
 *   <li>The {@link #transformExpression(Expression)} method is called to transform the current IR
 *       element. This method is called when the {@link org.enso.compiler.Compiler} traverses the
 *       element from bottom to top. All the children of the current IR element are already
 *       transformed when this method is called.
 * </ol>
