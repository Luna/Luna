## PRIVATE

   Dialect flags are used to specify implementation details for different
   dialects -- the existence or non-existence of certain features, or
   differening implementations of the same feature.

   Dialect flags differ from test config flags, in that they are used for
   implementation (as well as testing). They also differ from feature flags,
   since feature flags are user-facing, and can be used to identify features
   that are not yet implemented.
