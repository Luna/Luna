# Function types.
type Function

    ## A function is any type that represents a not-yet evaluated computation.

       Methods are represented as functions with dynamic dispatch semantics on
       the this argument.
    @Builtin_Type
    type Function

    ## Forces evaluation of a fully-applied but not evaluated function.

       This is particularly useful when you want to call a function that is
       fully applied with default arguments.

       This is usually _not_ the correct solution to a problem, and so should be
       used sparingly.

       > Example
         Evaluate a fully applied function to get 4.

            example_call =
                f (a = 2) = a * a
                f.call
    call : Any
    call = @Builtin_Method "Function.call"
