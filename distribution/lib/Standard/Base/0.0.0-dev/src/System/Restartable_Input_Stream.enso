## PRIVATE
   An input stream that can be read multiple times.

   It may be useful when multiple passes over the data are required.

   A generic stream can be converted to `Restartable_Input_Stream` by reading
   all its contents and storing them either in memory or in a temporary file.
   A stream backed by an existing file can be converted to
   `Restartable_Input_Stream` at no cost.
