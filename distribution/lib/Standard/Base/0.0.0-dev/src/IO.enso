## PRIVATE
   ADVANCED
   Prints the provided message to standard error.

   Arguments:
   - message: The message to print. It will have to_text called on it to
     generate a textual representation that is then printed.

   > Example
     Print the message "Oh no!" to standard error.

         IO.print_err "Oh no!"
print_err : Any -> Nothing
print_err message = @Builtin_Method "IO.print_err"

## PRIVATE
   ADVANCED
   Prints the provided message to standard output.

   Arguments:
   - message: The message to print. It will have to_text called on it to
     generate a textual representation that is then printed.
   - warnings: Whether to print any warnings that are attached to the value.
     Defaults to `False`, meaning that warnings are discarded.

   > Example
     Print the message "Oh yes!" to standard output.

         IO.println "Oh yes!"

   > Example
     Print the message "Hello! (1 warning attached)" to standard output.

         x = Warning.attach "WARN" "Hello!"
         IO.println warnings=True x
println : Any -> Boolean -> Nothing
println message warnings=False =
    println_builtin message warnings

## PRIVATE
   The builtin for the `println` method.
   Needed only because default arguments are not supported directly in builtins,
   so we need a level of indirection. `println` should always be sued instead.
println_builtin : Any -> Boolean -> Nothing
println_builtin message warnings = @Builtin_Method "IO.println_builtin"

## PRIVATE
   ADVANCED
   Reads a line from standard input.

   > Example
     Read a line from standard input.

         IO.readln
readln : Text
readln = @Builtin_Method "IO.readln"
