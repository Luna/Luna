type Join_Condition
    ## Specifies a join condition that correlates two columns from the left and
       right tables that satisfy the condition `<left> <op> <right>`.
    Compare (left : Column_Selector) (op : Join_Comparator) (right : Column_Selector)

    ## Specifies a join condition that is satisfied if either of the provided
       sub-conditions is satisfied.
    Or (left : Join_Condition) (right : Join_Condition)

    ## Specifies a join condition that is satisfied if both of the provided
       sub-conditions is satisfied.

       Most of the time instead of using this operator, one can just specify
       multiple join conditions, as their conjunction is used anyway. It may be
       needed however if some `Or` clause needs to consist of more complex
       conditions built with `And`.
    And (left : Join_Condition) (right : Join_Condition)
