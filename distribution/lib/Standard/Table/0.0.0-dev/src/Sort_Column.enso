type Sort_Column
    ## A column to sort by, selected by its name.

       For case insensitive column name matching, use the `Select_By_Name`
       selector.
    Name (name:Text=(Missing_Argument.throw "name")) direction:Sort_Direction=..Ascending

    ## A column to sort by, selected by its index.
    Index index:Integer=0 direction:Sort_Direction=..Ascending

    ## A selector allowing to match columns by their name.

       It can do regex-based and case insensitive matching if requested.
       It is possible for it to match multiple columns, in which case all the
       matched columns will be placed in the ORDER BY clause at the position of
       this selector. Their relative order between each other will be the same
       as in the table.
