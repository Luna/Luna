## AWS Region
type AWS_Region
    ## The default AWS region is inferred based on the following settings:
       1. If `AWS_REGION` environment variable is set, it is used as the default.
       2. If the `~/.aws` configuration specifies a region, it is used.
       3. If running in the Enso Cloud or on any EC2 instance, the region is inferred from the instance metadata.
       4. If the region cannot be inferred in any way, `eu-west-1` is used as a fallback.
    Default
