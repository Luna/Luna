  Unify this with the `index.html` in `lib/content`. The same HTML should be used in both places,
  and we should be launching the IDE the same way in both places. Currently we do not do this.

      Ask @mwu how to get TailwindCSS to play nice with the fact that `lib/authentication` is a
      dependency of `lib/content` and `lib/cloud` and not its own standalone package, so that we can
      use `@tailwind` directives in the `index.html` file.

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
