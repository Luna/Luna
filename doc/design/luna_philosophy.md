# Luna's Philosophy
Luna is a programming language unlike any that have come before it, a seamless
blend of code and visual communication that can span organisations.

## Tenets of Luna
As we design Luna, we rely on a small set of principles to guide the design and
evolution of the language. They are elucidated below. 

- **Visual and Textual:** The visual and textual syntaxes are both first-class.
  One is not translated to the other, but they are instead equivalent. New 
  features must work across both.
- **Unified Syntax:** The language syntax should be simple, concise, and be 
  usable at both the type and term levels.
- **Visual Communication:** A pure and functional language that lends itself 
  easily to visualisation of data-flows.
- **One Right Way:** There should, overwhelmingly, be only one way to perform a
  given task. Limited choice breeds simplicity.
- **Simple Complexity:** Though the language is backed by powerful functionality
  and compiler smarts, this should be invisible to the users until they care to
  engage with it.
- **Powerful When Necessary:** Designed to employ powerful techniques that
  confer safety and speed, allowing the users to write correct programs.
- **Performance and Predictability:** Predictable performance, with integrated
  debugging and profiling features to help users diagnose their problems.

## Designing Luna
As Luna's design and functionality evolves, we have to take the utmost care to
ensure that it doesn't balloon beyond control. As a result, every new feature 
that we contemplate adding to the language should advance these core tenets, and
thereby ensure that it matches with the overall vision for Luna.
